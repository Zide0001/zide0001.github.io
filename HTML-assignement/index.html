      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
      My name is <b>Joshua Zide</b>, but just <q>Josh</q>is good. I am a student at Algonquin college and I'm in my 1<sup>st</sup> year of the <i>Media Design program </i>. The Reason I chose this program is because I've always fun with <strong>web design and photography</strong>, and I thought to myself , <q>This is perfect!</q> And so far its been awesome.
      </p>  

      <p>
        Besides web design and photography, I have a couple other hobbies i like to participate in, such as <abbr title="Basketball"><b>Bball</b></abbr>
